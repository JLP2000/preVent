                <h2>Why venting is good for you</h2>
                <p>One of the main reasons why we vent is to reduce our stress levels. Rime (2009) states that disclosing stress is a coping mechanism. Venting is a 2-way process: the person venting and the person hearing the vent. <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">As a matter of fact, positive venting can reduce stress, but negative venting can lead to heightened stress and physical health concerns. It is not just about the person venting, but equally important, the person who is hearing the vent. Research has shown that the difference between positive and negative venting can be focused on the ways in which the person hearing the vent responds, both through speech and action (Bodie et al., 2015; Goldsmith, 2004) . This research supports numerous counseling theories and models that focus on active listening, empathy, and safety.</span></p>

              <p>Intially we wanted a website like twitter where you could just rant and get things off your chest, from this we found a website called muttr which was just for ranting but realised this would create a very negative enviroment. We wanted it to be a constructive enviroment, to achieve this we wanted inspirational quotes to try an inspire our clientel. We have also implemented a rudimental filtering system to disallow certain words to be posted. </p>

              <li>Certain categories on this website makes it harder to approach meaning the audience it is targeted at is too varying; swearing etc is allowed on this application - this might put people off from venting as they read through other people’s posts.</li>
              <li>Also, the application doesn’t allow users to “journal” anymore - it seems to have become a hub for troll posts - we have to create “prevention” methods. </li>
              <li>Venting is a two way process and unfortunately Muttr does not cater to this despite being a place to vent.

              </code></pre><p>We created a model and routes for this data, allowing for creating, read, update and delete. We created routes for /entries and for /entries/category allowing for us to easily access all the data and to filter by id and category.</p>
              <p>As we seperated into backend and frontend teams, the backend team created a <a href="./testclient">test client</a> with a single card that had full functionality with the post API and giphy API. This was to make it easy for process of combining the frontend and backend. </p>
              <p>During this the backend team also made a test suite that had 100% coverage for the API. </p>

              <h3 id="frontend">Frontend</h3>
              <p>We created the pages of the website using HTMl and used a combination of vanilla CSS and Javascript to style and add animations and intreactive elements to the pages.</p>
              <p>For the homepage we used TypeIt.js to create a typewriting effect, making the page much more interesting.</p>
              <p>The vents page, contains all the posts for our app in the form of cards in a masonary grid layout, inspired by the popular journaling app, Tumblr. The cards would pull data from the api and create new cards as posts are added. You can also comment on ech post, and the cards will display the newest three commments. In addition, they can also react to the post with an emoji, whcih will also count the number of reactions it has recieved. We also have a card that retrieves motivational quotes from an API. We also used anime.js to make the transitions on the page much smoother.</p>
              <p>On the nav bar; we also have a filter option as dropdown menu, which will filter out the data based on their category. There is also a pop-up window for new post entries. Here, you can choose a gif from the GIPHY API to go with your post.</p>
              <p>Lastly is the Preventers page, which simply tells you more about the group and the purpose of the website. All pages have a mark mode function, that turns color scale to grey.</p>
              <h3 id="combine">Combine</h3>
              <p>Combining the frontend and backend was a massive task. Implementing functionality took the whole team a day plus time for sorting out errors.</p>

              <ul>

              <li>We created a function that would accept any amount of data and automatically display it onto the page.</li>

              <ul>
              <li>For posting an entry to the website we had to use the fetch method &quot;POST&quot; with all the information to the API which would then be posted onto the website.</li>

              <ul>
              <li>For commenting on an entry there had to be a form that would be read and automatically used to update the data that it correlated to.</li>
              <li>The updating required thr method of &quot;PUT&quot; with all the original data and the updated data. </li>
              <li>The updated comment would then be automatically posted but the website only shows the top three comments.</li>
