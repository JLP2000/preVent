                <h2>Why venting is good for you</h2>
                <p>One of the main reasons why we vent is to reduce our stress levels. Rime (2009) states that disclosing stress is a coping mechanism. Venting is a 2-way process: the person venting and the person hearing the vent. <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">As a matter of fact, positive venting can reduce stress, but negative venting can lead to heightened stress and physical health concerns. It is not just about the person venting, but equally important, the person who is hearing the vent. Research has shown that the difference between positive and negative venting can be focused on the ways in which the person hearing the vent responds, both through speech and action (Bodie et al., 2015; Goldsmith, 2004) . This research supports numerous counseling theories and models that focus on active listening, empathy, and safety.</span></p>

                  <p>Intially we wanted a website like twitter where you could just rant and get things off your chest, from this we found a website called muttr which was just for ranting but realised this would create a very negative enviroment. We wanted it to be a constructive enviroment, to achieve this we wanted inspirational quotes to try an inspire our clientel. We have also implemented a rudimental filtering system to disallow certain words to be posted. </p>

                  <br>
                  This application allows you to vent in two ways: users being able to make posts and other users being able to read through these posts and make comments. </p>
                  <h3 id="functionality">Functionality</h3>
                  <p>For the design of the project we took the user specifications and segmeted them into system requirements. For this we created a google doc for everyone to just write down their ideas and then collate them into a list of steps and tasks to be completed.</p>
                  <h4 id="requirements">Requirements</h4>
                  <p><strong>User will be able to make an anonymous post</strong></p>
                  <p>Create a post</br>
                  Text box for user to input characters, capped at a maximum number of characters<br>
                  Gif button on the “create post” to access giphy and add a gif into the post<br>
                  Post button for user to create the post and push into the dataset<br>
                  Will include data and time of post<br>
                  Create categories for the user posts<br>
                  Filter certain words; slurs etc - to keep app ethical</p>

                  <p><strong>User will be able to use emojis (at least 3) to rate their post</strong></p>
                  <p>Emojis available under every post for users to react to posts by clicking the emoji</p>
                  User should be able to react using all available emojis</br>
                  Each emoji will have a reaction count to see how many other users have reacted</br>
                  <p>The emojis will be a pop up bubble - make it clean looking (like the message reactions)</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>User will be able to input 400 characters for each post</strong></p>
                  <p>
                  After 400 characters, the user will get an error message</br>
                  Event listener for each key stroke and then get the length of the input string</br>
                  Replacing names on posts with fun aliases</br>
                  </p>

                  <><strong>Users will be able to use giphy to add gifs/images to post</strong>
                  <p>A search bar within the create post block to allow users to search for specific gifs in the giphy api</br>
                  All gifs will be resized to fit the post block </br>
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>Users can view other people’s posts</strong></p>
                  <p>Fetching posts</br>
                  Timeline page so on the main page - you can see all the posts made by other users</br>
                  Create a card that can be reused for every post</p>

                  <p><strong>Mindful quote </strong></p>

                 <p>After user creates post, the app takes them to a random quote based on the category</p>
                  <p><storng>User must be able to comment on other people’s journal entries</storng></p>

                  <p>Replies to posts which will also be capped at a maximum character length</p>
                  <p><strong>Users will be able to rate their mood</strong></p>

                 <p>Users will rate their post with an emoji when they post it; this will allow others to see their mood before even reading their post (creating ease of use).</p>
                  
                  <p><em>Two ways to create comments?</em></p>

                  <p>Create comment on the same page where the comment box is unhidden and expanded<br>
                  Click into post (redirect to post only, displayed with comments)</p>

                  <p>Dislikes:</p>
                  <p>> Certain categories on this website makes it harder to approach meaning the audience it is targeted at is too varying; swearing etc is allowed on this application - this might put people off from venting as they read through other people’s posts.</br>
                  > Also, the application doesn’t allow users to “journal” anymore - it seems to have become a hub for troll posts - we have to create “prevention” methods.</br>

              <h4 id="creating-the-post-api">Creating the post API</h4>
              <p>To create the API we used express, nodemon/ node. We created the data to be able to handle all the data that the post could have: </p>
              <pre><code>userEntries = [
              {
              <span class="hljs-symbol">    id:</span> <span class="hljs-number">1</span>,

              <span class="hljs-symbol">    category:</span> <span class="hljs-string">""</span>,
              <span class="hljs-symbol">    entry:</span> <span class="hljs-string">""</span>,

              <span class="hljs-symbol">    comments:</span> []
              }
              ]
              </code></pre><p>We created a model and routes for this data, allowing for creating, read, update and delete. We created routes for /entries and for /entries/category allowing for us to easily access all the data and to filter by id and category.</p>
              <p>As we seperated into backend and frontend teams, the backend team created a <a href="./testclient">test client</a> with a single card that had full functionality with the post API and giphy API. This was to make it easy for process of combining the frontend and backend. </p>
              <p>During this the backend team also made a test suite that had 100% coverage for the API. </p>
              <p><img src="../client/img/image.png" alt="coverage"></p>
              <h3 id="frontend">Frontend</h3>
              <p>We created the pages of the website using HTMl and used a combination of vanilla CSS and Javascript to style and add animations and intreactive elements to the pages.</p>
              <p>For the homepage we used TypeIt.js to create a typewriting effect, making the page much more interesting.</p>
              <p>The vents page, contains all the posts for our app in the form of cards in a masonary grid layout, inspired by the popular journaling app, Tumblr. The cards would pull data from the api and create new cards as posts are added. You can also comment on ech post, and the cards will display the newest three commments. In addition, they can also react to the post with an emoji, whcih will also count the number of reactions it has recieved. We also have a card that retrieves motivational quotes from an API. We also used anime.js to make the transitions on the page much smoother.</p>
              <p>On the nav bar; we also have a filter option as dropdown menu, which will filter out the data based on their category. There is also a pop-up window for new post entries. Here, you can choose a gif from the GIPHY API to go with your post.</p>
              <p>Lastly is the Preventers page, which simply tells you more about the group and the purpose of the website. All pages have a mark mode function, that turns color scale to grey.</p>
              <h3 id="combine">Combine</h3>
              <p>Combining the frontend and backend was a massive task. Implementing functionality took the whole team a day plus time for sorting out errors.</p>
     <br>         
<h3>Display</h3>
              <p>To display the cards we had to dynamically create each element and systemeatically append each element to the document making sure each element had the correct class and id.</br>
              We created a function that would accept any amount of data and automatically display it onto the page.</p>

              <h3>Post</h3>
              <p>For posting an entry to the website we had to use the fetch method &quot;POST&quot; with all the information to the API which would then be posted onto the website.</p>

              <p>Commenting</p>
              <p>For commenting on an entry there had to be a form that would be read and automatically used to update the data that it correlated to.</br>
              The updating required thr method of &quot;PUT&quot; with all the original data and the updated data. </br>
              The updated comment would then be automatically posted but the website only shows the top three comments.</p>


              <p>Emoji</p>
              <p>For the emoji reactions the buttons needed to be linked to the data that everytime you clicked on the emoji it would increase the count of the corresponding emoji in the data.</br>
              Like the commenting it used the method &quot;PUT&quot; with teh original data.</p>

              <p>> We have an interactive random quote that can inspire our clientele</p>
              <p>> We have type.js that makes the homepage and preventers page more appealing and interesting</p>
              <p>> There is a character limit for the posts that also have a little count to show how many more characters can be posted</p>
              <p>> There is a filter on both post and comments to try and improve the constructive and supportive enviroment we are going for</p>

              <h3 id="challenges">Challenges</h3>
              <p>> Thinking of a unique layout (style) for the website that would suit the target audience</p>
              <p>> Combining the code for the frontend and backend of the website</p>
              <p>> Too much code written on one JS file</p>
              <p>> Difficult readability</p>
              <p>> Causing problems with navigating tags</p>
